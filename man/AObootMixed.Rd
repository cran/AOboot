\title{Bootstrapped ANOVA for Mixed Designs}
\description{
In case of violations of the assumption of the normal distribution, researchers
usually employ bootstrapping. Based on the \code{R} packages
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=afex/}{afex} and
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=emmeans/}{emmeans}, this function
computes bootstrapped confidence intervals for the effect sizes, estimated
marginal means, and post hoc tests for Mixed ANOVAs. Furthermore, the p-values
of the F-statistic are adjusted to reflect the probability to obtain equal or
higher values than the raw, non-bootstrapped ANOVA (Stine, 1989 <doi:10.1177/0049124189018002003>; see
also \href{https://www.uvm.edu/~statdhtx/StatPages/Resampling/Bootst1way/bootstrapping_oneway.html}{this tutorial by Nadine Spychala}.).}

\usage{
AObootMixed(var.within,
            var.between,
            var.id,
            levels.w1,
            levels.b1,
            eff.si = c("pes", "ges"),
            data,
            silence = FALSE,
            n.sim = 1000,
            alpha = .05,
            seed = 1234,
            n.round = 2)
            }

\arguments{
  \item{var.within}{Variable(s) reflecting the within-subject level.}
  \item{var.between}{Variable(s) reflecting the between-subject level.}
  \item{var.id}{Unique person specifier.}
  \item{levels.w1}{Levels of the within-subjects variable. Must be identical
  with the levels in the dataset.}
  \item{levels.b1}{Levels of the between-subjects variable. Must be identical
  with the levels in the dataset.}
  \item{eff.si}{Effect size for the F-tests. \code{pes} reflects partial
  eta-squared, \code{ges} reflects eta-squared.}
  \item{data}{Name of the dataframe. The dataset must be in a wide-format, with
  one row per participant.}
  \item{silence}{Logical. If FALSE, progress of the bootstrapping procedure will
  be displayed.}
  \item{n.sim}{Number of bootstrap samples to be drawn.}
  \item{alpha}{Type I error.}
  \item{seed}{To make the results reproducible, it is recommended to set a
  random seed parameter.}
  \item{n.round}{Number of digits in the output.}}

\details{The p-value of the F-test (\code{Pr(>F)}) in the output reflects the
probability to obtain an F-value as high as or higher than the F-value from the
raw, non-bootstrapped ANOVA. Thus, it should not be mistaken as a p-value in the
sense of a null hypothesis significance test. More information about this can be
found \href{https://www.uvm.edu/~statdhtx/StatPages/Resampling/Bootst1way/bootstrapping_oneway.html}{in this tutorial by Nadine Spychala}.}
